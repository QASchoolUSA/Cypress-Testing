Here’s a README.md template for a Cypress Automation framework, tailored to support TypeScript and Cypress 13.15:

Cypress Automation Framework

This repository contains an automation framework built with Cypress 13.15 and TypeScript for end-to-end testing. The framework is designed to provide reliable and scalable testing solutions with easy setup, modular test structure, and efficient TypeScript support.

Getting Started

This Cypress framework uses TypeScript for strong typing and improved maintainability. It’s suitable for running end-to-end (E2E) tests for web applications across different environments.

Prerequisites

	•	Node.js (version >= 14.x.x)
	•	npm or yarn

Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

.
├── cypress
│   ├── e2e                # Test files (specs)
│   ├── fixtures           # Test data files (JSON)
│   ├── support            # Custom commands and setup
│   │   ├── commands.ts    # Custom Cypress commands
│   │   └── e2e.ts         # Test setup and hooks
├── cypress.config.ts      # Cypress configuration in TypeScript
├── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
└── README.md              # Project documentation

Setup & Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cypress-automation-framework.git
cd cypress-automation-framework


	2.	Install dependencies:

npm install


	3.	Install Cypress:

npx cypress open



Running Tests

Running All Tests (Headless)

To execute all tests in headless mode:

npx cypress run

Running Tests with Cypress Test Runner (Interactive)

To open the interactive Cypress Test Runner:

npx cypress open

Configuration

The main configuration file is cypress.config.ts, where you can set global settings like baseUrl, environment variables, and test timeouts.

Example cypress.config.ts

import { defineConfig } from 'cypress';

export default defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000', // Set your application URL
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      // Add custom plugins or event listeners here
    },
    supportFile: 'cypress/support/e2e.ts',
  }
});

Writing Tests

Cypress tests are organized in the cypress/e2e directory. Each test file should have a .ts extension for TypeScript compatibility. Example test structure:

// cypress/e2e/example.spec.ts

describe('Example Test Suite', () => {
  it('Should load the homepage', () => {
    cy.visit('/');
    cy.contains('Welcome').should('be.visible');
  });
});

Custom Commands

Custom commands can be added in cypress/support/commands.ts for reusable actions like logging in or navigating to specific pages.

Example Custom Command

// cypress/support/commands.ts
Cypress.Commands.add('login', (username: string, password: string) => {
  cy.request('POST', '/login', { username, password });
});

Reporting

This framework supports multiple reporting options:

	1.	JUnit: Useful for CI/CD integration.
	•	Run with --reporter junit --reporter-options "mochaFile=results/my-test-output.xml"
	2.	Mochawesome: Generate HTML reports with Mochawesome for better visual insights.
	•	Install Mochawesome:

npm install --save-dev mochawesome


	•	Run with:

npx cypress run --reporter mochawesome --reporter-options "reportDir=cypress/reports"



Best Practices

	•	Use Page Objects: Keep locators and actions organized for modularity.
	•	Leverage Custom Commands: Reuse common actions like login, form submission, or API requests.
	•	Environment Variables: Store sensitive data like credentials in environment variables.
	•	CI/CD Integration: Use JUnit or other reporters for test result visibility in CI pipelines.
