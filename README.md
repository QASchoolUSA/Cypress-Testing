## Features

	â€¢	TypeScript Support: Strong typing and enhanced tooling.
	â€¢	Cypress 13.15: Latest Cypress features for reliable testing.
	â€¢	Modular Test Structure: Organized for maintainability and scalability.
	â€¢	CI/CD Ready: Seamlessly integrates with continuous integration workflows.

## Getting Started

This framework is designed for web application end-to-end testing, with a focus on reusability, consistency, and efficiency.

### Prerequisites

	â€¢	Node.js (version >= 14.x.x)
	â€¢	npm (or yarn)

### Installation

	1.	Clone the Repository and navigate to the project directory:

git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-directory]


	2.	Install dependencies:

npm install


	3.	Open Cypress to generate initial configuration files:

npx cypress open



### Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

.
â”œâ”€â”€ cypress
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ e2e                # Test files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures           # Test data (JSON files)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ support            # Custom commands and setup files
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ commands.ts    # Custom commands
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ e2e.ts         # Test setup and hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ cypress.config.ts      # Cypress configuration in TypeScript
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
â””â”€â”€ README.md              # Project documentation

## Running Tests

Run All Tests (Headless Mode)

To execute all tests in headless mode:

npx cypress run

Open Cypress Test Runner (Interactive Mode)

To open the interactive Cypress Test Runner:

npx cypress open

## Configuration

The main configuration file is cypress.config.ts, where you can adjust settings like baseUrl, environment variables, and test options.

Example Configuration in cypress.config.ts

import { defineConfig } from 'cypress';

export default defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000', // Set to your application URL
    supportFile: 'cypress/support/e2e.ts',
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      // Custom event listeners or plugins
    },
  },
});

## Writing Tests

Create test files in cypress/e2e with .ts extensions for TypeScript. Hereâ€™s a simple test example:

// cypress/e2e/example.spec.ts

describe('Example Test Suite', () => {
  it('Should load the home page', () => {
    cy.visit('/');
    cy.contains('Welcome').should('be.visible');
  });
});

## Custom Commands

Add reusable custom commands in cypress/support/commands.ts. This is useful for common actions like logging in or setting up test data.

Example Custom Command

// cypress/support/commands.ts

Cypress.Commands.add('login', (username: string, password: string) => {
  cy.request('POST', '/login', { username, password });
});

Donâ€™t forget to add custom command types in cypress/support/index.ts if needed.

## Reporting

The framework supports multiple reporting formats to visualize test results:

	1.	JUnit: Useful for CI/CD integration.

npx cypress run --reporter junit --reporter-options "mochaFile=results/test-output.xml"


	2.	Mochawesome: Generates visually rich HTML reports.
	â€¢	Install Mochawesome:

npm install --save-dev mochawesome


	â€¢	Run with Mochawesome:

npx cypress run --reporter mochawesome --reporter-options "reportDir=cypress/reports"



Best Practices

	â€¢	Use Page Objects: Keep locators and actions organized in page objects for reusability.
	â€¢	Environment Variables: Store sensitive data securely and avoid hardcoding in tests.
	â€¢	Custom Commands: Simplify repetitive tasks like login or data setup.
	â€¢	CI/CD Integration: Use JUnit or similar reporters for test visibility in pipelines.
